Learning to interact with AWS, and writing scripts to seed local databases.

1. This is a tech dry run for AWS. This is where I'll learn how to interact with the different services.

2. I will not be accepting any contributions to this repository, but please feel free to study the code, or ask me any questions.

3. Certain files are ignored for my privacy/safety.
